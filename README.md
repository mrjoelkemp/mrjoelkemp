### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joel and I'm currently a Staff Software Engineer at Spotify (since 2016), based in NY.

At Spotify, I've worked mostly on building big and ambitious monetization platforms:

* Building Spotify Ad Studio (a self-serve marketplace for audio ads) from $0 - tens of millions in revenue
* Building a high-margin content promotion offering in Spotify for Artists from $0 to millions in revenue

I believe in situational leadership, eating last, sponsoring others, and leading by example.

#### Technical Interests

* Currently: Elixir and the BEAM
* Previously: all things JavaScript

I used to do a lot of open source before having my beautiful children. I hack when I can.
